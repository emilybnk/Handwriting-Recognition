# Handwriting-Recognition

## Data
Load the data from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/landlord/handwriting-recognition?select=written_name_train_v2.csv

## Code
There are 7 code files:

read_data.py: reads and preocesses the data

encode.py: encodes the data

Model.py: Model 

train.py: trains the data and computes the loss

decode.py: decodes the predictions

evaluation.py: evaluates the accuracy of the Model

usage.py: use this function to execute all the implementations above.

### Run the Code
In order to run the code, download the data from kaggle. In the usage.py file change the directory in line 40 as well as line 40 of the read_data.py file. Then execute all of the files mentioned above. Keep in mind to execute usage.py last since this file loads functions from the other files.

## Requirements
The python version 3.9 was used. The external packages that were used can be found in the "requirements.txt" file.
